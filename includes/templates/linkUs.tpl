<h2>Link us</h2>
<p>If you have a website or similar, a link to us would be most appreciated. Feel free to use our logo (without modifications) where you see fit. While we do own a few domains, could you link to <strong>lanlist.info</strong> please. If possible, save the images to your webserver instead of hotlinking them.</p>
