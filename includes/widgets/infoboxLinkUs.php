	<h2>Link to lanlist.org on your website?</h2>
	<p>As you are logged in as an organizer, can we tempt you to link to lanlist.org on your website?</p>
	<p>Linking to us helps drive more traffic to our site - more organizers and more punters. We like to see people from the community using the site!</p>
